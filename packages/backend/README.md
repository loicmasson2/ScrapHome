# Backend

## Getting started

`docker-compose up -d --build`

Can access `http://127.0.0.1:8008/homes/20136296`

## Roadmap

I want to use this BE not to serve the data ( Next.js will do that ), but to be able to trigger the crawling and analysis from the outside.  

- [ ] connect to the same DB as the Next.js
- [ ] how to trigger crawler
- [ ] how to trigger analysis
